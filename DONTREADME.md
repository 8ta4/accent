## Goals

### Accuracy

> Does `accent` measure if I'm pronouncing things like a native speaker?

Nope, `accent` isn't about matching a standard. Hereâ€™s why:

- Machine Understandability: As voice tech gets more common, it's important that machines get what you're saying. Accent aims to improve how well speech recognition systems understand you, not just how "correct" your accent sounds.

- Variability: Pronunciation standards vary widely even among native speakers. Languages and accents evolve. Keeping a up-to-date list of all these variations is a huge task.

> Is `accent` 100% accurate with its pronunciation checks?

Yes, within the context of how `accent` defines accuracy. `accent` is all about enhancing how well machines understand you. It uses speech recognition technology to evaluate your speech. This is the gold standard, and by that measure, `accent` nails it.

### Latency

> What is the latency goal?

The goal is to keep response times within 1 second.

> Why a 1-second latency goal?

1 second is pretty much the limit for keeping your flow of thought uninterrupted. Quick feedback is crucial to keep you focused. That's why the interface is tweaked to make things feel faster.

### Cost

> What is the cost goal?

I want to keep the cost under $100 a month.

This decision is influenced by comparisons with:

- Personal Pronunciation Coaching: Personal pronunciation coaching can go for about $1,000 a month. `accent` offers a lot at a fraction of that price, making it a budget choice.

- Other Productivity Tools: Lots of the top tools that help you out professionally are priced under $100 a month.

> Does `accent` make personal pronunciation coaching obsolete?

No. Here's a list of benefits that personal pronunciation coaches offer that the `accent` tool doesn't currently provide:

- Accent Influence Analysis: Coaches can spot how your usual accent messes with the new one you're learning.

- Phonetic Explanations: Coaches can delve into phonetic phenomena that might be affecting your pronunciation.

- Recurring Issue Identification: Coaches are great at spotting recurring issues with specific sounds.

- Study Plans: Coaches can set you up with study plans tailored just for you.

- Motivational Support: Coaches do that keep you motivated, which is important for sticking with your practice.

## Evaluation

> Can the pronunciation score take a positive value?

Yes. The score in the accent tool can totally be positive. Normally, the score is the difference between two probabilities. Since both probabilities are between 0 and 1, the difference will range from -1 to 1.

> What probabilities may be used to calculate the pronunciation score?

The score is calculated using probability that may include:

- User's Speech Probability: This is the probability assigned by the speech-to-text API to each word it successfully transcribes from your speech. This probability reflects the system's confidence in its transcription of what you said.

- Reference Speech Probability: This is the probability assigned by the speech-to-text API to each word it successfully transcribes from the reference speech. The reference speech is generated by first converting the original text to speech using text-to-speech technology, and then back to text. This probability serves as a benchmark for ideal pronunciation.

> Does each word in the user's speech have a corresponding word in the reference speech?

Nope, it's not a sure thing. The whole process of turning text to speech and then back to text isn't an involution. Ideally, converting text to speech and then transcribing it back to text should return the original text. But in reality, this back-and-forth can mess things up because the tech isn't flawless.

> What is the score when a word in the user's speech has a corresponding word in the reference speech?

When there is a corresponding word in the reference speech, here's how I figure out your score:

$$\text{Score} = P_{\text{user}} - P_{\text{reference}}$$

Here, $P_{\text{user}}$ is the probability of your word. That's how sure the system is that it heard you right. And $P_{\text{reference}}$ is the probability of the corresponding word in the reference speech.

> What is the score when a word in the user's speech does not have a corresponding word in the reference speech?

When there is no corresponding word in the reference speech for a word you said, the score is:

$$\text{Score} = P_{\text{user}} - 1$$

Here, $P_{\text{user}}$ is the probability of your word.

This means I take your word's probability and subtract it from 1, which is the perfect score, assuming the reference would have been spot on.

> Why not use a ratio of probabilities to calculate the pronunciation score?

Using a ratio of probabilities sounds neat until you hit a snag where both probabilities are zero. That gives you something like $\frac{0}{0}$, and math doesn't like that. It's undefined.
